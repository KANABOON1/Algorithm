# This is my Algorithm repository

## First Step

Finish some little algorithm projects on the Princeton University's Coursera, and this is what I have done:

- [x] [Percolation](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php)
- [x] [Double-ended queue and Randomized Queue](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php)
